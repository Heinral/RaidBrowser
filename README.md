# RaidBrowser
A Raid Browser Addon for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a

The addon parses LFM messages sent in any chat channels the player is currently in. Any found raids will be listed in Blizzard's 
LFR raid browser, which is unused in patch 3.3.5a. 

# Features

- Raid hosts that do not send a message after 1-2 minutes will have their entry expire in the raid browser.
- Join / Double click: After clicking on an entry in the raid browser, send a formatted message to the raid host with your GS, class and spec.
- Tooltip Hover: Hovering your mouse over an entry in the raid browser shows the original chat message, as well as how long it's been since the mssage was sent.
